## Description

This application acts as the back end framework for an e-commerce site. 

It can be tested and used through Insomnia and allows the user to get, create, update, and delete tags, categories, and products. 

Through building this application I learned the importance of model associations and what things to look out for specifically in a many to many relationship. 

A video walkthrough of the application can be found here: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/KTIbfSUeKjUZdmvanArE
